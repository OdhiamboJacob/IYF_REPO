        <h1 style="color:red">My Rediscovery in Programming</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p title="Snapshot of the journey" style="color:chartreuse">
            In the vast tapestry of life, there are moments of departure and return, of journeys taken and paths rediscovered. 
            Such is my story, Odhiambo Jacob, a GIS graduate whose passion for programming lay dormant, awaiting the spark of resurgence. 
            Join me as we delve into the narrative of my great comeback to programming, a journey marked by challenges, triumphs, and the timeless pursuit of innovation.
        </p>
        <h2>The Descent</h2>
        <p title = "how I went down and stoped programming" style="color:coral";>
            Once, I traversed the realms of programming with fervor, each line of code a brushstroke on the canvas of innovation.
             But life's vicissitudes led me away from my digital domain.
             Graduating from Taita Taveta University with a degree in Geoinformatics, I delved into the intricate world of GIS and Remote Sensing, each project a testament to my passion for technology. 
            Yet, as time passed, the fervent hum of algorithms faded, replaced by the quietude of routine
        </p>
        <h2>The Awakening</h2>
        <p title="Rejuvination and starting programming again" style="color:blue";>
            Amidst the tranquil monotony, a spark ignited within me, a whisper from the past urging me to return to my roots. 
            With determination as my compass, I embarked on a journey of rediscovery.
            I immersed myself in the latest developments in programming, rekindling my love for logic and syntax.
            Each line of code resurrected memories of past triumphs, igniting a fire that had long lain dormant.
        </p>
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p title="obstacles trough the new journey" style="color:pink";>
            But the path to resurgence was fraught with challenges.
            The digital landscape had evolved, morphing into a labyrinth of new languages and paradigms.
            Undeterred, I embraced the challenge, leveraging my experience in GIS and Remote Sensing to approach programming from a fresh perspective. 
            With each hurdle surmounted, my confidence grew, fueling my determination to reclaim my place in the ever-changing world of technology.
        </p>
        <h2>The Triumph</h2>
        <p title="uprising and suprising the flowbacks" style="color:yellow";>
            And then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, I emerged victorious.
            Armed with newfound knowledge and unwavering resolve, I embarked on a journey of innovation and discovery.
            My comeback to programming was not merely a return to the familiar; it was a rebirth, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. 
            With each project completed, each line of code written, I forged ahead, a beacon of inspiration for those who dare to dream.
        </p>
        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p title="lessons attached" style="color:aqua";>
            In the annals of my journey, I found not just a resurgence in programming, but a reaffirmation of my passion for technology. 
            Through the highs and lows, the triumphs and tribulations, I discovered that true fulfillment lies not in the destination, but in the journey itself. 
            And so, with a heart full of gratitude and a mind ablaze with possibility, I continue to navigate the ever-changing currents of the digital landscape, forever driven by the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.
